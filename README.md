
# Azure Communication Services RealTime Voice Agent

This is a sample that will enable you to build a realtime voice agent using Azure Communication Services

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 
- A deployed Communication Services resource. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource).
- A [phone number](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/telephony/get-phone-number) in your Azure Communication Services resource that can get inbound calls. NB: phone numbers are not available in free subscriptions.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7 or above.
- An Azure OpenAI Resource and Deployed Model. See [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).



### Setup and host your Azure DevTunnel

[Azure DevTunnels](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) is an Azure service that enables you to share local web services hosted on the internet. Use the commands below to connect your local development environment to the public internet. This creates a tunnel with a persistent endpoint URL and which allows anonymous access. We will then use this endpoint to notify your application of calling events from the ACS Call Automation service.

```bash
devtunnel create --allow-anonymous
devtunnel port create -p 8000
devtunnel host
```


### Add the API keys and endpoints in the project

The `.env ` file will contain various API keys and endpoint configurations which are required for this sample, for example to update the OpenAI Connection String update the `AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_SERVICE_KEY` value

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_SERVICE_KEY="<UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

Ensure that the `ACS_SMS_FROM_PHONE_NUMBER` is the acquired phone number from the ACS resource in the E.164 phone number format. For example:

```bash
ACS_SMS_FROM_PHONE_NUMBER="+18662358536"
```

### Setup and run the Python environment

The command below will automatically install the required python version and package dependencies defined in the `pyprojec.toml` file

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the project locally using the command:

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
